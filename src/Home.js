As a writer, there are a lot of reasons to embrace the digital age.

In fact, right now is probably one of the best times in history to be a writer because there are so many platforms and resources available at the touch of your fingertips thanks to technology.

Where once you may have had to attend poetry classes and workshops, read text book after text book and attend lecture after lecture to master the art of writing poetry, now you can find all of the information you need on your phone or tablet.
